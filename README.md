PYTHON APP - REQUIRES LIBRARIES PIP, PYSIMPLEGUI, MYSQL-CONNECTOR

PIP is installed with recent versions of Python however I have noticed the appsanywhere version version doesn't include it.

installLibs.py is on the root of the repo and will install pysimplegui and mysql-connector using PIP.

view/main.py will start the app.
