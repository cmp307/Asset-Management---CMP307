This vulnerability allows session IDs to be reused, which could provide unauthorized access to the BMC under certain circumstances. This vulnerability does not affect ThinkSystem XCC, System x IMM2, or other BMCs.

HP Elitebook has 4 vunerability(s)Severity Level: HIGH Description:The System Management Mode (SMM) implementation in Dell Latitude E6430 BIOS Revision A09, HP EliteBook 850 G1 BIOS revision L71 Ver. 01.09, and possibly other BIOS implementations does not ensure that function calls operate on SMRAM memory locations, which allows local users to bypass the Secure Boot protection mechanism and gain privileges by leveraging write access to physical memory.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Conexant Systems mictray64 task, as used on HP Elite, EliteBook, ProBook, and ZBook systems, leaks sensitive data (keystrokes) to any process. In mictray64.exe (mic tray icon) 1.0.0.46, a LowLevelKeyboardProc Windows hook is used to capture keystrokes. This data is leaked via unintended channels: debug messages accessible to any process that is running in the current user session, and filesystem access to C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log by any process.Severity Level: no rating avaliable Description:The HP lt4112 LTE/HSPA+ Gobi 4G module with firmware before 12.500.00.15.1803 on EliteBook, ElitePad, Elite, ProBook, Spectre, ZBook, and mt41 Thin Client devices allows remote attackers to modify data or cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors.Severity Level: no rating avaliable Description:The HP lt4112 LTE/HSPA+ Gobi 4G module with firmware before 12.500.00.15.1803 on EliteBook, ElitePad, Elite, ProBook, Spectre, ZBook, and mt41 Thin Client devices allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

Python has 20 vunerability(s)Severity Level: CRITICAL Description:An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. There is an out-of-bounds read in J2kDecode, in j2ku_graya_la.Severity Level: CRITICAL Description:An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. There is an out-of-bounds read in J2kDecode, in j2ku_gray_i.Severity Level: CRITICAL Description:This affects all versions of package html-to-csv. When there is a formula embedded in a HTML page, it gets accepted without any validation and the same would be pushed while converting it into a CSV file. Through this a malicious actor can embed or generate a malicious link or execute commands via CSV files.Severity Level: HIGH Description:Synapse is a package for Matrix homeservers written in Python 3/Twisted. Prior to version 1.47.1, Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory. No authentication is required for the affected endpoint. The last 2 directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact. Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers with a federation whitelist are also unaffected, since Synapse will check the remote hostname, including the trailing `../`s, against the whitelist. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.47.1 or later. Server administrators using a reverse proxy could, at the expense of losing media functionality, may block the certain endpoints as a workaround. Alternatively, non-containerized deployments can be adapted to use the hardened systemd config.Severity Level: HIGH Description:http.client in Python 3.x before 3.5.10, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, 3.7.x before 3.7.9, and 3.8.x before 3.8.5 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in the first argument of HTTPConnection.request.Severity Level: HIGH Description:The rencode package through 1.0.6 for Python allows an infinite loop in typecode decoding (such as via ;\x2f\x7f), enabling a remote attack that consumes CPU and memory.Severity Level: HIGH Description:The AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java, Python, C++ and Node.js appends a user supplied Certificate Authority (CA) to the root CAs instead of overriding it on Unix systems. TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the peer can be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system’s default trust-store. Attackers with access to a host’s trust stores or are able to compromise a certificate authority already in the host's trust store (note: the attacker must also be able to spoof DNS in this case) may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning. An attacker could then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop traffic and/or respond with the attacker's data, but they would not be able to forward this data on to the MQTT broker because the attacker would still need the user's private keys to authenticate against the MQTT broker. The 'aws_tls_ctx_options_override_default_trust_store_*' function within the aws-c-io submodule has been updated to override the default trust store. This corrects this issue. This issue affects: Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java versions prior to 1.5.0 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python versions prior to 1.6.1 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for C++ versions prior to 1.12.7 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Node.js versions prior to 1.5.3 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS-C-IO 0.10.4 on Linux/Unix.Severity Level: HIGH Description:The AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java, Python, C++ and Node.js appends a user supplied Certificate Authority (CA) to the root CAs instead of overriding it on macOS systems. Additionally, SNI validation is also not enabled when the CA has been “overridden”. TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the peer can be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system’s default trust-store. Attackers with access to a host’s trust stores or are able to compromise a certificate authority already in the host's trust store (note: the attacker must also be able to spoof DNS in this case) may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning.

This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+..) .Severity Level: HIGH Description:A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Visual Studio Code when the Python extension loads configuration files after opening a project, aka 'Visual Studio Code Python Extension Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1192.Severity Level: HIGH Description:A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Visual Studio Code when the Python extension loads workspace settings from a notebook file, aka 'Visual Studio Code Python Extension Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1171.Severity Level: HIGH Description:The package pillow 5.2.0 and before 8.3.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the getrgb function.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:urllib3 before 1.25.9 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest(). NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2020-26116.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:/options/mailman in GNU Mailman before 2.1.31 allows Arbitrary Content Injection.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:All versions of package reportlab are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) via img tags.

NOTE: The vendor does not consider this a vulnerability of the Unbound software. create_unbound_ad_servers.sh is a contributed script from the community that facilitates automatic configuration creation. It is not part of the Unbound installation.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Stored XSS can execute as administrator in quarantined email detail view in Sophos UTM before version 9.706.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Elasticsearch before 7.14.0 did not apply document and field level security to searchable snapshots. This could lead to an authenticated user gaining access to information that they are unauthorized to view.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Headers that are not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed list are ignored and protect users from "Cache poisoning" attacks. In Symfony 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests when it is not trusted.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions a maliciously crafted request could cause an error response to be cached by intermediate proxies. This could cause a loss of confidentiality for some content. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Dell EMC PowerScale Nodes contain a hardware design flaw. This may allow a local unauthenticated user to escalate privileges. This also affects Compliance mode and for Compliance mode clusters, is a critical vulnerability. Dell EMC recommends applying the workaround at your earliest opportunity.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Python discord bot is the community bot for the Python Discord community. In affected versions when a non-blacklisted URL and an otherwise triggering filter token is included in the same message the token filter does not trigger. This means that by including any non-blacklisted URL moderation filters can be bypassed. This issue has been resolved in commit 67390298852513d13e0213870e50fb3cff1424e0Severity Level: no rating avaliable Description:Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.Severity Level: no rating avaliable Description:Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."

Bluetooth has 20 vunerability(s)Severity Level: CRITICAL Description:An issue was discovered in gatt-database.c in BlueZ 5.61. A use-after-free can occur when a client disconnects during D-Bus processing of a WriteValue call.Severity Level: HIGH Description:A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. There isn't any check on whether there is enough space in the destination buffer. The function simply appends all data passed to it. The values of all attributes that are requested are appended to the output buffer. There are no size checks whatsoever, resulting in a simple heap overflow if one can craft a request where the response is large enough to overflow the preallocated buffer. This issue exists in service_attr_req gets called by process_request (in sdpd-request.c), which also allocates the response buffer.Severity Level: HIGH Description:Uncontrolled Recursion in the Bluetooth DHT dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.17 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture fileSeverity Level: HIGH Description:Buffer overflow in the Bluetooth HCI_ISO dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture fileSeverity Level: HIGH Description:Buffer overflow in the Bluetooth SDP dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.17 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture fileSeverity Level: HIGH Description:Large loop in the Bluetooth DHT dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.9 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.17 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture fileSeverity Level: HIGH Description:Improper access control in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.Severity Level: HIGH Description:Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.Severity Level: HIGH Description:The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing.Severity Level: HIGH Description:In onCreate of BluetoothPairingDialog, there is a possible way to enable Bluetooth without user consent due to a tapjacking/overlay attack. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10Android ID: A-182282956Severity Level: HIGH Description:Improper handling of the full-buffer case in the Zephyr Bluetooth implementation can result in memory corruption. This issue affects: zephyrproject-rtos zephyr version 2.2.0 and later versions, and version 1.14.0 and later versions.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:There is an Input verification vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause Bluetooth DoS.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service and shutdown of a device by flooding the target device with LMP_features_res packets.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:An issue was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. The vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data. The root cause can be found in the function service_attr_req of sdpd-request.c. The server does not check whether the CSTATE data is the same in consecutive requests, and instead simply trusts that it is the same.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:A Red Hat only CVE-2020-12352 regression issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled the initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:In SOOIL Developments Co., Ltd Diabecare RS, AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A, a client-side control vulnerability in the insulin pump and its AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A mobile applications allows physically proximate attackers to bypass checks for default PINs via Bluetooth Low Energy.Severity Level: MEDIUM Description:In SOOIL Developments Co., Ltd Diabecare RS, AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A, a client-side control vulnerability in the insulin pump and its AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A mobile applications allows physically proximate attackers to bypass user authentication checks via Bluetooth Low Energy.Severity Level: LOW Description:An improper access control vulnerability in BluetoothSettingsProvider prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows untrusted application to overwrite some Bluetooth information.
